        "question": "How do we define sustainability at Green Cloud Nine?",
        "answer": "For us, sustainability means to use natural, social and economic resources in a way that allows us to meet our needs, but also respects the right of future generations to cover their own. To be fair & transparent to our customers and vendors, we adopt a holistic approach that considers both the producer and the product: Our vendors are expected to be sustainable at human, social, economic and environmental levels. Also, to ensure consistency, we have defined 10 product sustainability categories or impact areas. Each product must comply with at least two of the categories below: ðŸŒ¿ Organic Raw Materials ðŸŒ¿ Durable & extended life ðŸŒ¿ Resource & Energy efficient. Reduced CO2 impact ðŸŒ¿ Pollution-reduced production ðŸŒ¿ Fair & social ðŸŒ¿ Vegan ðŸŒ¿ Produced Regionally ðŸŒ¿ Recyclable, postable, Biodegradable ðŸŒ¿ Recycled, Upcycled, Second-hand ðŸŒ¿ Handmade & Made to order"

    {
        "question": "How does it work with the shipment of goods?",
        "answer": "At the beginning, every vendor will pack and ship their orders to the customers, just as they do it today. Soon in the future, we will offer a centralized and more sustainable logistic solution that will make it easier, more cost efficient and sustainable to deliver across Europe. More to come on this!"
    },
    {
        "question": "Are the shipments CO2 neutral?",
        "answer": "That is definitely the goal at Green Cloud Nine. In some countries, vendors will be able to deliver their goods to their customers CO2 neutral. But, for some vendors, offering CO2 neutral deliveries is not yet possible. In this case, we offer the customers a possibility to add a small fee to their order at check-out to offset the CO2 emissions. The fee will be 1% for national & 2% for international deliveries. The customer will be able to select which certified environmental projects they support with this money."
